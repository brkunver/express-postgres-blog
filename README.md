# express-postgres-blog

Express blog app with heroku postgres database

This app gets title and content of blog posts and show preview in home page, and you can click detail and read more.

I use Bootstrap, Postgres, Sequelize, Express and Ejs Libraries in this project

- Note : I was using a free mysql database when I first created this project. It created some problems then I switched to Heroku Postgresql database
